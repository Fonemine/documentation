# MobileForce Expressions: Language and Usage in Low Code Application Development

The Visual software development constructs in MobileForce Low-code/No-code Platform empower the citizen developer to visually create and connect with drag and drop, application components to easily create powerful enterprise applications. However, there are often situations when someone with development skills (for example, a business analyst) that go beyond the citizen developer, would like to rapidly construct custom forms or  UI elements using expressions to combine existing constructs in a powerful yet fairly composable manner. It is precisely for this purpose that MobileForce Expressions are created as a a powerful enhancement to the MobileForce Low-code/No-code platform. 

MobileForce expressions  extend the automation capabilities of the MobileForce Platform in ways that otherwise could only be achieved by an enterprise software developer, but without the learning and implementation overhead of a software development environment. 
The common expression language defined here is the common foundation, used to create powerful automation features in several different MobileForce products such as CPQ, Forms, and potentially even Field Service. 

Simply put, MobileForce expressions enhance forms with  dynamic functionality that enable dynamic (i.e., at run-time) changes to the **value** of form fields and sections, and in general any  **form elements**. Furthermore, MobileForce expressions also support dynamic modification to the **visibility** and **editability** of form elements. MobileForce expressions are easy to write using plain text fields within various elements of MobileForce Applications such as CPQ, and potentially also Field Service. Within MobileForce CPQ, expressions are specifically used to enhance Rules, Triggers, Macros, Email Templates etc.

## 1. MobileForce Expression Language (MFEL)s.

Often, expressions in MobileForce are used in form expressions, CPQ rules, triggers, macros, email templates, etc. All of these uses  build upon **MFEL** in unique ways.
